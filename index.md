# Emotional Robot
This will serve as a brief description of your project. Limit this to three sentences because it can become overly long at that point. This copy should draw the user in and make she/him want to read more.

# Second Milestone
For my second milestone I finished the project.  I used CAD to make 2 of the 3D-printed pieces and it was not the most enjoyabe experienence.  Onshape was a bit finniky for me and getting measurements right took a long time, compounded with the fact that many times the sketches I make can't exist according to the software I had to make the face plate and mount many times.  The ultrasonic sensor is how the robot get's the input.  Depending on how far something is from the robot it will either be angry, happy, or scared.  The byte arrays are different for each emotion and the pan and tilt servos can move if the robot is angry.

# First Milestone
My first milestone was wiring everything up and getting different bits and pieces of the robot to work.  I also made some of the pieces(ultrasonic sensor, 16x8 matrix, and 16x2 matrix) work at the same time.  There were ups and downs during all this.  For example in the 16x8 matrix the solder was connected to the copper underneath, causing it to short circuit.  It was resolved quickly once it was noticed and nothing was damaged.  Making the byte arrays for the 16x8 matrix was very relaxing for me.  It was a simple task I could be creative with and it was a good change of pace compared to the other parts of the project.

# Starter Project
My starter project was the useless machine.  It had 2 switches, a LED light, and an arm attatched to a motor.  The electric motor operates through the interactions between the motor's magnetic field and electric current in a wire winding to generate force in the form of torque applied on the motor's shaft, which is what moved the arm.  I enjoyed soldering the parts together, but I had some difficulties with the switch as the solder got on the other side of the board, and I was not able to get it out, so I had to redo the project.  I also had some issues with putting the box together because the columns were self-threading so there were issues with getting the screws in.  In the end we used power tools to help get the screws in.
